About a decade ago, I found an interest in dance as a form of connecting with others and deeply influencing their lives through a unique medium. Since then, I've:

 ➥ Attained multiple promotions, climbing from trainee all the way to general management while 
 achieving top teacher and top supervisor awards during multiple years, due to high sales parameters 
 and high team productivity with myself as the lead.

 ➥ Collaborated with and advised a franchisee in developing a business plan and marketing/sales 
 strategy for a brand new studio, which contributed to over a 50% increase in profitability over the 
 course of one year.

 ➥ Decorated as a top dancer, and achieved some of the highest certification levels available (with less 
 than 5% of teachers achieving this in their careers); always striving for excellence in whatever I set out to 
 do.

Presently, I've re-discovered a passion for numbers, and my dance students that currently work in the Business Intelligence field have inspired me to use that passion and talent to make a difference in people's lives on a larger scale. My goal is to find a position that allows me to use my analysis skillset to benefit communities and consumers, all while increasing profitability for the companies involved. As anyone who knows me can tell you, I do love a good puzzle. 

I want to use my curiosity, passion to inspire and better the lives of others, and deep-seeded commitment to excellence to not only provide well written and thought out analyzes to your company, but also create drive and momentum for my future team and coworkers. When everybody is of one spirit, some of the most inspiring work can be drawn out. 

If you are offering, or know of, any opportunities that align with my goals, please reach out to me either here on LinkedIn or via email at 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐳𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐥.𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐥@𝐠𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐥.𝐜𝐨𝐦. I can't wait to meet you virtually and quite possibly be the next bright-eyed member of your team.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ioGMLdCFkXVXGN1iuwyjyqJXP3a179fQgt_OoBSDgrg/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
